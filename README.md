## Overview

**One liner:** Platform for Generative AI Assisted Smart Contract Development with Retrieval Augmented Generation

`Ink!jet` is a platform designed to use augmented generative AI with the intent of improving the development lifecycle of `ink!` smart contracts within the Polkadot ecosystem. Recognizing the technically intricate nature of smart contracts and the high level of expertise they demand, our project aims to simplify these complexities, thereby democratizing the creation process.

Existing generative AI have limitations in both the amount of `Rust` and `ink!` code in their training data. Our platform uses a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline with datasets of collected and generated `ink!` smart contracts to bridge this knowledge gap. Injecting vectorstore retrieved code into prompts, this system utilizes in-context learning to improve response quality. Our platform also offers an in-browswer IDE that users can use without the complications of setting up a local environment. Our goal is to enhance the productivity of existing developers through bootstrapping and assisted code interation, while simultaneously lowering the barrier of entry for new developers.
